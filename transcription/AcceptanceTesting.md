# Indaba Transcription Acceptance Testing

Goal of the testing: study/watch users using the app and examine
what aspects of the app work and don't

## Instructions

Everyone will get a tablet, and will be tasked with Transcribing a video
using the Indaba app.

The steps are as follows:

- Everyone will chunk, and transcribe individually

- Then, everyone will review everyone's responses

<!-- As you use the app feel free to voice any concerns/ask questions

Also, if you have any feedback as you use the app, feel free to voice
that also -->

# Oucomes

- More convenient pausing button for transcribing (just above keyboard)

- Keep pause button on screen at all times

- Back/Forward 5 seconds buttons in transcribing section on video.

- Button to highlight a section you're not sure about (for review later)

- Keep keyboard active when button is pressed

- Make slider bigger

- Bigger chunk button

- Automatically break chunks down into 3/5 second sections for transcribing

- These 3/5 second second chunks should automatically replay/loop themselves and automatically pause when the user starts typing.

- Intro text split out over two (or more) pages for readability

- Intro text only appears once, and then a button to make it reappear.

- Keep video controls on screen at all times (?)

- Use dots just below video to show progress through current chunk

- Highlight scrobbler track to show the current chunk you're transcribing

# Issues

- Performance of video scrobbling needs to be improved

- Automatic scroll into view not working consistently

- Selecting video to transcribe dynamically is broken

- Seek bar not staying in sync sometimes.
